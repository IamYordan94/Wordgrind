Project Title: Progressive Wordle Grind

Idea / Concept:
We want to create a Wordle-inspired “grind” game where the player starts with 2-letter words and progresses to longer words (3-letter, 4-letter, etc.) as they complete all words of the current length. The goal is to provide an endless, level-based word puzzle experience with progression, feedback, and tracking.

Core Features:

Word Levels:

Level 1: 2-letter words

Level 2: 3-letter words

Level 3: 4-letter words

…and so on, up to a reasonable max (e.g., 7 letters).

Gameplay Mechanics:

Player guesses words like Wordle.

Feedback:

Green = correct letter in correct place

Yellow = correct letter in wrong place

Gray = letter not in word

Player continues until they find all words of the current length.

Progression System:

Tracks found words per level

Once all words of a level are found → unlocks next level

Shows progress bar / percentage completed

UI Requirements:

Input box for guesses

Feedback displayed dynamically (color-coded like Wordle)

Progress panel showing found words and current level

Optional: hint button, restart level button

Data / Words:

Use pre-defined lists of words by length

Level 2 → all valid 2-letter English words (~100–150)

Level 3 → all valid 3-letter words (~400–500)

Level 4 → all valid 4-letter words (~1,000+)

Words stored in JSON or JS arrays

Optional Features for MVP:

Daily challenge mode (optional)

Timer or streak counter (optional)

Basic CSS for readability, but not final polish

Technical Requirements:

Must be fully in HTML/CSS/JS

Works in Replit with copy-paste only

Fully interactive in the browser

No backend required, store words and progress in local JS arrays or localStorage

Output Expectation from Replit AI:

Full HTML file with embedded CSS and JS (or separate CSS/JS files if preferred)

Implements:

Level-based Wordle grind

Color-coded feedback

Progress tracker for words per level

Unlocking mechanism for next level

Testable directly by opening the HTML in browser

Tone / Style for Code:

Clean, readable, and copy-paste ready

Functional MVP first; styling minimal but usable
