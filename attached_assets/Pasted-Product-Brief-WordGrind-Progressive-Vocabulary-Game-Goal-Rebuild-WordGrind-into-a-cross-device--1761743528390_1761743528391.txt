Product Brief: WordGrind – Progressive Vocabulary Game
Goal

Rebuild WordGrind into a cross-device, monetized vocabulary game that replaces the old level-based structure with a progressive daily learning system.
Players discover new words, learn definitions, and climb toward mastery while balancing free play limits and paid progression.
The experience must run smoothly on mobile, tablet, and desktop browsers.

Non-Goals

No ads or third-party banners anywhere.

No external login systems for free users (localStorage is enough).

No new mini-games; only refine existing ones.

No backend-heavy multiplayer features.

Roles

Free Player: can discover up to 20 new words/day, 500 total lifetime words.

Paid Player: unlocked after 500 words; can discover 50/day; eventually earns lifetime access after mastering half the dictionary.

Admin (optional): manages word data (JSON updates) and reviews definitions.

Core Workflows

Word Discovery Flow

Player types a word in the discovery box (initially limited by dropdown to 2–9 letters).

System validates word length, checks against JSON word bank, fetches definition, and stores result in localStorage.

Word added to Vocabulary Journal with definition and part of speech.

Mini-Games Flow

User selects a mini-game (Word Grind, Definition Mode, Scramble, Hangman, Mix Match).

Completing mini-game yields a valid word which can be claimed into the discovery system.

Free players have cooldown timers (2 min normal / 5 min Mix Match). Paid players have no cooldowns.

Progression Flow

Free users capped at 20 new valid words/day, 500 lifetime.

Upon reaching 500, prompt to subscribe.

Paid users capped at 50/day.

Once a user discovers 58,535 total words → automatic lifetime unlock (no further payment).

Journal Flow

Free: last 100 discovered words, read-only, definition + POS only.

Paid: unlimited storage, notes, search/filter, export, stats.

Data Model & API Surface

Data Source: words_data.json (levels 2–9, each with {word, pos, definition}).

Storage:

Free players: localStorage only.

Paid players: extendable to cloud or persistent ID if accounts added later.

APIs:

Definition fetcher (existing).

Payment/subscription API (to add).
